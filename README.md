# Pizza Ordering App

This is a small little application I made for a job coding challenge. It's a pizza ordering app which allows you to create your own pizza and after creation it will show you the pizza you created and the total cost of that pizza.

# Requirments

1. Java JDK 8+
2. Maven
3. Git

# To Install

1. Make a directory where you want this to be saved and clone this repo: (Put this on your command line)

   `git clone https://github.com/bboyjacks/OrderingPizzaApp`
   
2. Package the app using maven

   `cd OrderingPizzaApp`
   
   `mvn package`
   
3. Run the .jar created by maven
 
   `java -jar target/pizzaorder-1.0.1.jar`
